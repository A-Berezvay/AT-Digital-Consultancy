    <h1>What is SEO?</h1>
    <p>Search engine optimisation (SEO) is the practice of developing a website to improve its ranking in search engine results pages. When increasing search engine ranks, it will increase organic traffic to your website. This means that when somebody searches for a particular word associated with your business, it will position your website further ahead in the search without any paid advertisement. This action drives website traffic, generating leads for your services or products, and potentially introduce you to your future customers.</p>

    <h2>SEO Strategies</h2>
    <p>Requires you to utilise various strategies starting by developing a process based on your analysis and objectives that you would like to achieve. This is where the hard work starts moving onto on-page optimisation such as headers and titles, design, layout, keyword planning, visible contents overall as well as off-page optimisation with the focus on meta tags, back links to maximise the potentials of your website.</p>
    <p>We at AT Digital are a group of genuinely enthusiastic geeks that have been studying and testing search engine algorithms to offer you with useful and practical solutions with measurable goals and easy to read monthly reports.

    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p>We begin by understanding your business objectives, target audience, and competitive landscape. We conduct thorough website audits and keyword research to uncover opportunities and challenges that may impact our strategy.</p>

    <h3>Optimisation</h3>
    <p>In this phase we will focus on tailoring your website to maximise its search engine potential, based on the insights collected during the Analysis. Our core focus is on the title tags, meta descriptions, site performance, and mobile compatibility to help you stand out in the organic search.</p>

    <h3>Assessment</h3>

    <p>We refine your SEO approach through ongoing assessments, real-time data adjustments, and user behaviour. This ensures the optimisation adapts to market conditions, trends, and algorithms, driving long-term success and keeping you ahead of your competition.</p>

    <h2>How Search Engine Works?</h2>
    <p>The visibility of your page will be highly dependent on the rigorous algorithms built into the search engines. They follow three steps for positioning: screening your pages through:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>web crawlers</p>
        <li>indexing it to make an understanding of your contents</li>
        <li>placing which determines your position on the search page.</li>
        <li>We understand how time-consuming and stressful this process is. This is where AT Digital provides hands-on solutions, so you can focus on other aspects of your business while we position you for the right audience.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Crawlers</h3>
    <p>Search engines use software called web crawlers that find information of your website’s pages using bots (also known as spiders). Google uses Googlebot. This allows them to check millions of web pages instantly. Since website pages and URLs are not registered manually with the search engine, the crawlers are looking for new contents, pages, and updates. This is the first part of the process to get to know your existence in the digital landscape.</p>

    <h3>Indexing</h3>
    <p>When your page is crawled by the bots, the search engine starts the second step of its process, which is indexing. This is the stage when the collected data of your pages will be analysed. Indexing will focus on the content of your pages such as texts, headers, images, and activities.</p>
    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <p>Imagine this process like sorting files on your computer. When you group certain files into folders, you categorise your data. This is exactly what happens when the search engine indexes your pages. To be successful in this stage, our experts focus passionately on originality, updates, and contents that will help you stand out.</p>

    <h3>Placing</h3>
    <p>This is the last step that determines the positioning of your website on the search page. When it comes to placing (ranking) a website's order in the search page, the search engine uses hundreds of different factors to decide the actual position of your page. Although there is a sequence of the steps, step 1 and step 2 are continuously running in the background analysing pages and websites to be able to provide you with real-life data on your search. Therefore, continuous updates on step 1 and step 2 are crucial to be relevant.</p>
    <h4>Example:</h4>
    <p>Ranking is best described as you were walking past a bookshop with its latest best-seller book plastered all over the window; upon entering, you saw the very same books on a table in the centre of the hallway, tempting you to come in and take a look before making your decision. Search engines function as digital libraries, continuously analysing website data, traffic, originality, demand, location, and language, summarising it to present its users with the best match for their search.</p>

    <h2>How Search Engine Ranks Your Page?</h2>
    <p>As we mentioned earlier, search engines use hundreds of factors to decide the position (ranking) of your website. This is the key recipe for relevant content for each search. It’s not always enough to provide the best service or product. For easier understanding, you could be the best-rated dentist practicing in Brighton, UK, just an hour away from central London, UK. When someone searches for a dentist, the search engine will consider location, rates, website traffic, and reviews to suggest the best available dentist for each search.</p>

    <h2>How to Achieve the Highest Ranking in SERP?</h2>
    <p>Customer-centric approach helps you achieve your targets. We emphasize conducting a thorough analysis of your business environment, researching your target audience, and knowing your demographics (location). We believe these are the key factors for small-medium businesses to scale or individuals ready to start their journey. Using the combination of these factors will help you get to know how to interact with your existing and new customers. With this knowledge, you will be able to design your website and its pages to reach the right audience and stay ahead of your competitors. You don’t have the extra time to deal with SEO? Don’t look further! AT Digital is here to provide you first-class service for SEO.</p>
